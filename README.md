## :wave: I'm Nima ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=nhejazi&color=green)

- I'm a (bio)statistician and postdoctoral researcher whose work combines
  causal machine learning and non/semi-parametric estimation.
- I enjoy developing open source software to improve the accessibility and
  increase the adoption of cutting-edge statistical methods.
- are you looking for open source software for _targeted_ causal machine
  learning? check out the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and
  [its handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook)!
- if we have shared interests and you'd like to chat about them, feel free to
  ping me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/nshejazi) or consider just
  [contacting me](https://nimahejazi.org/#contact) directly.
