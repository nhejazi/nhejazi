## you've found Nima ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=nhejazi&color=blue)

I'm an academic (bio)statistician working at the interface of causal inference,
machine learning, and nonparametric statistics. I greatly enjoy developing open
source software to improve the accessibility and adoption of modern methods for
statistical inference and causal machine learning.

Are you looking for open source software for _targeted_ causal machine learning?
Check out the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and look through
our (_free_) open source [handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook)!
