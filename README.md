I'm an academic [(bio)statistician and statistical
scientist](https://nimahejazi.org/about). My work sits at the interface of
statistical causal inference, causal/de-biased machine learning, semi-parametric
estimation, statistical machine learning, and computational statistics.

- I organize the [NSH Lab](https://github.com/nshlab) (pronounced like "niche"),
  a statistical science research group that develops theory, methods,
  algorithms, and open-source software tools to improve causal-analytic and
  statistical learning. Research in the group is motivated directly by and tied
  to data-driven questions in the applied biomedical and health sciences.
- A while ago, I co-created and served as a core developer for the [`TLverse`
  project](https://github.com/tlverse), an open-source software ecosystem of
  R packages for Targeted Learning; the project includes an [open-source
  handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook) to guide implementation.
  <!--
  The TLverse project is a core component of [Project
  ICTML](https://www.ictml.org/), a scalable platform for machine learning and
  causal inference.
