## hey there, i'm nima ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=nhejazi&color=blue)

i'm an academic (bio)statistician working at the interface of causal inference,
machine learning, semi-parametric statistics, and computational statistics. i'm
passionate about building accessible open-source software for model-agnostic and
assumption-lean statistical and causal machine learning methods, and i'm most
easily excited by problems at the interface of statistics and the biomedical and
public health sciences.

are you looking for open source software for *targeted* causal machine learning?
consider checking out the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and
browsing our open source [handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook)!
