- i'm wrapping up my phd in biostatistics and will be starting a postdoctoral
  research fellowship working in statistical causal inference.
- i enjoy working on statistical methodology and developing software for
  nonparametric causal inference and causal machine learning.
- looking for open source software for _targeted_ causal machine learning?
  check out the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and [our open
  handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook)!
