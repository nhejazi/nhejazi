I'm an [academic (bio)statistician](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/nima-s-hejazi/)
working at the interface of causal inference, debiased and/or targeted machine
learning, semi-parametric estimation, statistical machine learning, and
computational statistics.

- I currently manage the [NSH Lab](https://github.com/nshlab) (pronounced like
  "niche"), a (bio)statistical science research group that is dedicated to the
  development of theory, methods, algorithms, and open-source software for
  causal-analytic and statistical learning techniques, often inspired by open
  questions in the biomedical and public health sciences.
- A while ago, I co-created and served as a core developer for the [`tlverse`
  project](https://github.com/tlverse), an open-source software ecosystem of
  R packages for Targeted Learning; the project includes an open-source
  [handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook) to guide implementation of
  the methods.
