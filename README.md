I'm an academic (bio)statistician working at the interface of causal inference,
machine learning, and non/semi-parametric statistics. I enjoy building open
source software tools to improve the accessibility and adoption of modern
methods for statistical inference and causal machine learning, and I'm
particularly excited by the applications of statistics to the biomedical and
public health sciences.

Are you looking for open source software for _targeted_ causal machine learning?
Consider checking out the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and
browsing our (_free_) open source
[handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook)!
