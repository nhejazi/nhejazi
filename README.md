I'm an [academic (bio)statistician](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/nima-s-hejazi/)
working at the interface of causal inference, machine learning, semi-parametric
statistics, and computational statistics.

- I currently manage the [NSH Lab](https://github.com/nshlab), which focuses on
  developing theory, methods, and open-source software for causal and 
  statistical learning, often inspired by problems in the biomedical and public
  health sciences
- I co-created and served as a core developer for the [`tlverse`
  project](https://github.com/tlverse), an open-source software ecosystem of
  `R` packages implementing Targeted Learning statistical methods; the project
  includes an open-source [handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook) to
  guide implementation of these techniques.
