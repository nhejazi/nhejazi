## Hey, I'm Nima

- I'm wrapping up my PhD in biostatistics and will be starting a postdoctoral
  research fellowship working in statistical causal inference.
- I enjoy working on statistical methodology and developing software for
  nonparametric causal inference and causal machine learning.
- Looking for open source software for _targeted_ causal machine learning?
  Check out the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and [our open
  handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook)!
- If we have shared interests and you'd like to chat about them, feel free to
  reach out [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nshejazi) or [contact
  me](https://nimahejazi.org/#contact) directly.
