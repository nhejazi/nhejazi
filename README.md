I'm an [academic (bio)statistician](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/nima-s-hejazi/)
working at the interface of causal inference, machine learning, semi-parametric
statistics, and computational statistics.

- I currently manage the [NSH Lab](https://github.com/nshlab) (pronounced like
  "niche"), a research group focused on developing theory, methods, and
  open-source software for causal-analytic and statistical learning, most often
  for application to problems in the biomedical and public health sciences.
- A while ago, I co-created and served as a core developer for the [`tlverse`
  project](https://github.com/tlverse), an open-source software ecosystem of
  R packages for Targeted Learning; the project includes an open-source
  [handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook) to guide implementation of
  the methods.
