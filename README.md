## :wave: hey, you found nima ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=nhejazi&color=green)

- i will soon start as a postdoctoral researcher working in statistical causal
  inference.
- i enjoy working at the intersection of causal inference, non/semi-parametric
  estimation, and machine learning, and developing open source software.
- are you looking for open source software for _targeted_ causal machine
  learning? check out the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and
  [our handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook)!
- if we have shared interests and you'd like to chat about them, feel free to
  ping me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/nshejazi) or consider just
  [contacting me](https://nimahejazi.org/#contact) directly.
