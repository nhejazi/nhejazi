- i will soon start as a postdoctoral researcher working in statistical causal
  inference and non/semi-parametric estimation with machine learning.
- i enjoy developing open source software to improve the accessibility and
  adoption of cutting-edge statistical methods.

  learning? check out the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and
