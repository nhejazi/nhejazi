I'm an [academic (bio)statistician](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/nima-hejazi/).
My work sits at the interface of causal inference, de-biased and/or targeted
machine learning, semi-parametric estimation, statistical machine learning, and
computational statistics.

- I lead the [NSH Lab](https://github.com/nshlab) (pronounced like "niche"), a
  statistical science research group that is focused on developing new theory,
  methods, algorithms, and open-source software tools for causal-analytic and
  statistical learning techniques. Work in my group is usually inspired
  directly by and tied to open questions in the biomedical and public health
  sciences.
- A while ago, I co-created and served as a core developer for the [TLverse
  project](https://github.com/tlverse), an open-source software ecosystem of
  R packages for Targeted Learning; the project includes an open-source
  [handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook) to guide implementation of
  the techniques. The TLverse project is part of the [ICTML
  Project](https://www.ictml.org/), a scalable platform for machine learning
  and causal inference.
