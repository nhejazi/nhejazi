## :wave: Hey, I'm Nima

- I'm wrapping up my PhD in Biostatistics and will be starting an NSF
  postdoctoral research fellowship working in causal inference for complex
  study designs.
- I work on statistical methodology and develop software for nonparametric
  causal inference and causal machine learning.
- Are you looking for software tools for causal machine learning? Check out
  the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and [its
  handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook)!
