I'm an [academic (bio)statistician](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/nima-s-hejazi/)
working at the interface of causal inference, debiased and/or targeted machine
learning, semi-parametric estimation, statistical machine learning, and
computational statistics.

- I currently direct the [NSH Lab](https://github.com/nshlab) (pronounced like
  "niche"), a (bio)statistical science research group that works to develop
  theory, methods, algorithms, and open-source software for novel causal-analytic
  and statistical learning techniques, often inspired directly by open questions
  in the biomedical and public health sciences.
- A while ago, I co-created and served as a core developer for the [`tlverse`
  project](https://github.com/tlverse), an open-source software ecosystem of
  R packages for Targeted Learning; the project includes an open-source
  [handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook) to guide implementation of
  the methods.
